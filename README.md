# RezStrafe_cpp-v6.0
UPD: Now RezStrafe have version for fullscreen Half-Life using.

Rules same as before, Insert - start, Delete - end, F1 - new mode (buggy)

Start "RezStrafe-cpp_fullscreen.exe" for fullscreen mode.

Now RezStrafe have new variable - "Pluser", now RezStrafe make more "+"values, and too little "-"values, so need minus more than plus, "Pluser" is that cint, what will be minused.

P.S. Sry for bad english :)
